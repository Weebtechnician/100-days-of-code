# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 1, 2023


**Today's Progress**: Completed Section 7 of Dr. Angela's web development course. Added a static navigation bar to the top of my website.

**Thoughts:** Really struggled to understand positioning in CSS. I feel like I have a better grasp of it now, but it's definitely something to work on.

### Day 1: August 2, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Started section 8 of the web dev course. Implemented grid and flexbox into my personal website. I want to make it more responsive so I'm working towards that slowly. Used @media to change the layout of the website for mobile, wasn't working at first and after a few hours I told out I used a "=" when I should've used a ":". Oh well.

**Thoughts:** Pretty solid day, I learned a lot and made what I think is some pretty solid progress. Can't wait for javascript.

### Day 2: August 3, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished section 9, implemented flex into my contact page and learned more about grids. I feel like I didn't work a lot on my website today, it was mostly learning. But it's progress.

**Thoughts:** Spent around 6 hours of coding/lessons but I don't feel like I accomplished much today. That's okay though! I did enough.

### Day 3: August 4, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about grid, fixed some unnecessary code on my website, and made the contact page slightly more responsive. Couldn't do a whole lot today unfortunately. 

**Thoughts:** I really feel like I need a solid 4 hours everyday to feel productive. 2 hours just really isn't enough for me to feel like I did much.
