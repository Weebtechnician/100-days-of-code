# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 1, 2023


**Today's Progress**: Completed Section 7 of Dr. Angela's web development course. Added a static navigation bar to the top of my website.

**Thoughts:** Really struggled to understand positioning in CSS. I feel like I have a better grasp of it now, but it's definitely something to work on.

### Day 1: August 2, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Started section 8 of the web dev course. Implemented grid and flexbox into my personal website. I want to make it more responsive so I'm working towards that slowly. Used @media to change the layout of the website for mobile, wasn't working at first and after a few hours I told out I used a "=" when I should've used a ":". Oh well.

**Thoughts:** Pretty solid day, I learned a lot and made what I think is some pretty solid progress. Can't wait for javascript.

### Day 2: August 3, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Finished section 9, implemented flex into my contact page and learned more about grids. I feel like I didn't work a lot on my website today, it was mostly learning. But it's progress.

**Thoughts:** Spent around 6 hours of coding/lessons but I don't feel like I accomplished much today. That's okay though! I did enough.

### Day 3: August 4, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about grid, fixed some unnecessary code on my website, and made the contact page slightly more responsive. Couldn't do a whole lot today unfortunately. 

**Thoughts:** I really feel like I need a solid 4 hours everyday to feel productive. 2 hours just really isn't enough for me to feel like I did much.

### Day 4: August 5, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Bootstrap and put together two websites using it. Wow what an easy way to through a website together. I also made some slight adjusts to my own personal website today but after learning about bootstrap I almost want to entirely pivot my website to using bootstrap. At the same time though it'll be useful to keep it using traditional css so when I start learning JS I can incorporate that into my website. Maybe I'll do both?

**Thoughts:** Put a lot of time in today between the lessons and actual coding. Feels really good.

### Day 5: August 6, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Not a whole lot of coding today but I learned a good amount about web design as a concept. Which I actually feel like I definitely needed. My old site page really didn't have in mind the experience of the user. So I barely started working on completely redoing my site. I'll work on it a lot more tomorrow but for now I need to wind down before work tomorrow.

**Thoughts:** UX is really important and I'm glad I learned about it more today. Can't wait to see how everything comes together.
