# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 1, 2023


**Today's Progress**: Completed Section 7 of Dr. Angela's web development course. Added a static navigation bar to the top of my website.

**Thoughts:** Really struggled to understand positioning in CSS. I feel like I have a better grasp of it now, but it's definitely something to work on.
